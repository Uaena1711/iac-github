# CHANGELOG

This file lists changes to the iac-github Actions catalog. Versioning follows SemVer;
`metadata.json` `version` is the source of truth and drives the auto-release on `main`.

## 2.0.0

- **BREAKING:** replaced the matrix paved-road (`terraform.yml`) with a **per-environment
  reusable workflow** `tf-env.yml`. The consumer calls it once per env and decides gating
  per env (e.g. `dev` auto, `prod` approval). Each call is its own job graph, so a `prod`
  awaiting approval never blocks `dev`. Migrate callers from one `terraform.yml` job to one
  `tf-env.yml` job per env (see the example repo).
- apply runs only when the plan has changes, so an unchanged env never fires its approval
  gate (`tf-run` now exposes a `has_changes` output).
- Add a `resolve-env` building block: an env's `tf-ci.env` picks a secret provider at the
  file level (`SECRETS_PROVIDER=`, overridable by the `secrets_provider` input) and uses
  `${REF}` placeholders that are pulled from a vault, masked, and written back in place
  (job-local, never an artifact). Providers are plugins (`providers/<name>.sh`); `github`
  (vars/secrets) and `awssm` (Secrets Manager) ship in the box. Backward-compatible:
  literal `tf-ci.env` files (no `SECRETS_PROVIDER`) are untouched.
- `resolve-env` also supports `emit: github-env`: it resolves an optional per-stack
  `tf-vars.env` and exports each entry as `TF_VAR_<name>` to `$GITHUB_ENV` (masked,
  multiline-safe), so **sensitive Terraform input variables** are injected as environment
  variables — never written to disk — and Terraform reads them natively. Mark such
  variables `sensitive = true` to redact them from plan output. Wired into `plan`/`apply`;
  a no-op when the stack has no `tf-vars.env`.
- Add a `tf-docs` building block + a `tf-docs.yml` reusable workflow: on a push, regenerate
  each module's README with terraform-docs (pinned + checksum, inject mode) and commit the
  result back to the branch. The doc commit carries a `[skip ci]` token (and is made with
  `GITHUB_TOKEN`), so it never re-triggers a pipeline. No-op when docs are already current.
- Building blocks: `secret-scan`, `tf-lint`, `detect-changes`, `aws-oidc`, `resolve-env`, `tf-run`, `tf-docs`.

## 1.2.0

- Add a `tf-lint` building block (`terraform fmt -check` + tflint, pinned + checksum) and
  wire it into the flow as a gate alongside secret-scan: `secret_scan + lint → plan → apply → check`.
- Fix: nested workspaces (e.g. `envs/<env>/<region>/`) now work in the change-detection
  path — replaced a `case` inside command substitution (parser quirk on older shells) with
  a portable prefix test. Detection maps a changed file to its nearest `provider.tf`
  ancestor at any depth; the GitHub Environment is the first path segment under the root.

## 1.1.0

- Layering: the terraform flow now composes a `secret-scan` (gitleaks) building block as a
  gate before any cloud access — consumers get secret detection automatically.
- Destroy is integrated into the same `terraform.yml` via `mode: destroy` + `dir` (manual
  `workflow_dispatch`), using a reviewed destroy-plan applied behind the Environment gate
  (no blind `destroy -auto-approve`).
- `check` is now terminal (runs after apply) so the required status reflects the whole pipeline.
- Configurable `tf-run` inputs: `var_file`, `tf_{init,plan,apply,destroy}_options`.
- Examples moved out of the catalog into a dedicated consumer repo (linked from the README).

## 1.0.1

- Live end-to-end test on a real runner (OIDC plan/apply, environments, release).

## 1.0.0

- Initial release: Terraform run flow (detect → plan → apply).
- Composite actions: `detect-changes`, `aws-oidc`, `tf-plan`, `tf-apply`.
- Reusable workflow `terraform.yml` (detect → plan → apply → check) with per-stack OIDC
  and GitHub Environments gating.
- Self-CI (actionlint + version validation + secret scan) and metadata-driven auto-release.
